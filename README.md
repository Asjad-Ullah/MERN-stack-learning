# MERN-stack-learning
This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and practice the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Each day, I will add code samples, notes, and any relevant resources or references. This is a personal project to track my learning journey and to serve as a reference for myself and others who are learning the MERN stack.
